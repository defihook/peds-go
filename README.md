Type safe persistent/immutable data structures for Go.

An experiment in how close to generics that code generation can take you.

Uses https://github.com/cheekybits/genny for code generation.

Right now there's not a lot around here but the plan is for a persistent vector, map and set.

Inspired by Clojures data structures and the work done in Pyrsistent for python.
